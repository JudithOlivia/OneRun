## What is SuperRun?
SuperRun is a browser game where I used superman in the Flappy Bird game concept. Instead of a bird, you control Superman flying through a city skyline, navigating between buildings while gravity pulls him downward.

## Why I Made This Project
I love superman and the new movie inspired me more. Also, I got a sudden nostalgia for flappy bird--a game I used to play as a kid--but later found out that the game discontinued. So, I decided to make my own. 


## How I Made This Project
I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This is my firsttime building a game with JavaScript so I used Youtube as well. 

### Challenges
Problem: Initial collision boxes were either too sensitive or not sensitive enough

Solution: Implemented precise bounding box calculations with proper edge cases
